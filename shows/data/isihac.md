[Love Graphs](http://www.lovegraphs.com/random/gender-equality/film-tv/panel-shows.html) kindly provided episodes from 2012-2015. Episodes from 2015 onwards are from iPlayer. Episodes from 2009-2012 are from [comedy.co.uk](http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/isihac/episodes/). Before 2009 are a mixture of iPlayer and the [BBC's Genome Project](http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/) which has digitised the Radio Times. We don't have much data on the first 25 series (pre-1995) so, if you do, please consider contributing.
