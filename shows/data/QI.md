This [Independent article from 2009](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/funny-thing-our-new-women-comics-are-invisible-1752301.html) talks about the lack of women on QI.

I'd previously used IMDB as a source for QI but it over-estimated appearances by 25%. I first switched to comedy.co.uk and later to iPlayer as a source. IMDB seems to have been over-estimating the number of women more than it over-estimated the men!

In 2016 Sandi Toksvig took over from Stephen Fry as host of QI. Having a woman as a regular is one way to make a large difference to the overall stats.
