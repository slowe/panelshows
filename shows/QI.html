	<div class="show" id="QI">
					<p>It seems there may have been at least <strong>229 shows</strong> and 1147 listed appearances. With 5 people per show, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ml0g">iPlayer</a> and <a href="http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/">Comedy.co.uk</a> have <strong>0% more appearances listed than required</strong> (and probably a similar percent of people) perhaps due to listing special guests. The host/captains/regulars have included <a href="../people/hk2rczao.html">Alan Davies</a> (Regular &times; 229), <a href="../people/fc3xrxvy.html">Stephen Fry</a> (Host &times; 187), <a href="../people/nch01m5e.html">Sandi Toksvig</a> (Host &times; 42, Panellist &times; 17).</p>

			<p>
This <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/funny-thing-our-new-women-comics-are-invisible-1752301.html">Independent article from 2009</a> talks about the lack of women on QI.</p><p>I'd previously used IMDB as a source for QI but it over-estimated appearances by 25%. I first switched to comedy.co.uk and later to iPlayer as a source. IMDB seems to have been over-estimating the number of women more than it over-estimated the men!</p><p>In 2016 Sandi Toksvig took over from Stephen Fry as host of QI. Having a woman as a regular is one way to make a large difference to the overall stats.
