		<h1>UK Comedy Panel Show Age By Year</h1>
	<p>By <a href="https://mastodon.me.uk/slowe">@slowe@mastodon.me.uk</a>. <strong>Last updated 11 March 2024</strong></p><p>A heat-map showing a yearly breakdown of age across episodes of <a href="index.html">UK comedy panel shows</a> on TV and radio. The ages for every appearance on a comedy panel show episode is calculated and then binned to make a heat map. The darker the green colour of a cell, the more people were that age. The diagonal lines hint at individuals who have appeared on long-running shows.</p><table class="yearly"><tr><th>Year</th><th>Age (years)<br /><table><tr><th class="split">0</th><th
